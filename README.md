# Mainline Menswear Mobile App Technical Test

This test is an opportunity to showcase your development skills as well as your attention to detail. You are more than welcome to develop your mobile application using any choice of framework or development tool. Therefore you can develop your mobile application as a hybrid application (Ionic, Flutter, React Native Mobile) or as a native mobile application (Swift, Kotlin). 

You can decide which platform to work with, so either **iOS** or **Android**. We don’t expect you to package your application or submit the application to a store, we just want to see your source code and we’ll look to preview your application in a development environment on our devices. 

The following github repo contains a simple app design flow that we would like you to follow. We will provide you two API endpoints that will return data back via JSON. It is therefore up to you to use this data to present the data back in a design similar to the mockup app design flow provided. 

The endpoint URLs are list below:
- https://frontendtest.mainlinemenswear.co.uk/products
- https://frontendtest.mainlinemenswear.co.uk/product/{productId}

You have a choice of screen A or B when deciding how you want to style the three products that are returned. You can choose to do one or you can choose to do both if you want to add an additional feature. Only do this if you have the time. 

Please make sure to test your mobile application and please add commments to your code so we can understand your thought process. 

## What we're looking for
We're looking to see at what stage you're at in terms of your career in app development. There are bonus points for adding the ability to save your size choice once you've selected it and show the saved choices in a seperate screen. Only do this if you feel confident in using app local storage. Also we'd love to see some app only features such as vibrations when press buttons, etc. If you feel there is something missing you'd like to add, then do so but only if you feel you have time to do it. 

Don't put too much pressure on yourself!

## Submission
Once you're happy with your test, please commit all your work into your own github repository and add **mmw-frontend** as a contributor to your repo.

Good luck and we look forward to seeing you mobile application!
